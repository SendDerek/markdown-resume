Hiring Team
MagicSchool

Alexander Deceglie reached out to me about the Staff Software Engineer position at MagicSchool. After exploring your platform and mission, I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity.

As a parent with three kids (my oldest just graduated high school, and two are in middle school), I have a personal stake in education technology that actually works. Several of my close friends are teachers, and I've heard their perspectives on daily challenges in the classroom. This isn't just another engineering role for me—it's a chance to work on something meaningful where I can see the impact firsthand and get real feedback from people I care about.

I bring **10+ years building scalable platforms** that serve thousands of users. At General Indemnity Group, I've led the consolidation of backend systems into a unified Laravel stack while establishing TDD practices and CI/CD pipelines. I've taken end-to-end ownership of complex features from architecture through production deployment.

Your stack aligns well with my experience. My deepest expertise is in **Laravel PHP and backend systems**, with solid production experience in TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and React. I'm also building my own React Native mobile app, so I understand balancing speed with the reliability users depend on.

What excites me most is the combination of **technical leadership and mentorship**. At Pathlabs, I mentored a 4-person team while architecting AWS infrastructure and building data pipelines processing substantial ad spend. I thrive when I can influence architectural decisions and help raise the bar for technical excellence.

MagicSchool's values around empowering educators and fostering community during technological change align perfectly with my own focus on meaningful work and service. I'd love to learn more about your technical roadmap and the challenges you're tackling as you scale.

Thank you for considering my application.
