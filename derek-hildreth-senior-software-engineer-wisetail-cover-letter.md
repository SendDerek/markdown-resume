Intertek Wisetail  
Bozeman, MT

Thanks for reaching out about the Senior Software Engineer position at Wisetail. I'm excited to learn more about the role and how things have evolved at Wisetail since I last spoke with David Campbell and Terri Bermea back in March 2023 about the Lead Software Engineer position. The timing wasn't right then (I had just started at General Indemnity Group), but I've continued following Wisetail's growth. When you reached out, I was genuinely excited to reconnect.

What draws me to Wisetail is the mission. I have three kids (my oldest just graduated high school, and two are in middle school), so education technology that actually helps people learn hits close to home. Several of my close friends are teachers, and I've heard their stories about the daily challenges they face. Building tools that genuinely support workforce development and training is exactly the kind of meaningful work I'm looking for.

I bring 10+ years of backend engineering with deep expertise in Laravel PHP, which aligns perfectly with your tech stack. At General Indemnity Group, I've spent the last year and a half consolidating three backend systems into a unified Laravel stack, establishing TDD practices (400+ tests from scratch), and building CI/CD pipelines. I've taken features from concept through production deployment, working closely with stakeholders to translate business needs into technical solutions.

Your requirement for a strong backend focus with cross-stack collaboration matches my experience well. While my deepest expertise is in Laravel and backend architecture, I've worked with Vue and React, and I'm comfortable picking up Angular. At Pathlabs, I mentored a 4-person team while building data pipelines and backend services managing substantial ad spend.

Since we last spoke, the experience at General Indemnity Group has deepened my technical leadership skills and confirmed what I'm looking for next: a collaborative environment where I can contribute my backend expertise while working closely with a tight-knit team. The timing feels right now.

What excites me most about this role is working in a small, experienced team where I can contribute across the stack and participate in technical discussions that shape the product. The fact that this role is onsite in Bozeman is actually a plus for me - I'm in Belgrade, just 15 minutes away. I value the face-to-face collaboration and spontaneous problem-solving that happens when teams work together in person.

I'd love to learn more about Wisetail's technical roadmap and the challenges you're tackling as you scale. I'm looking forward to our conversation.

Thanks again for reaching out. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to what you're building here in the Bozeman community.
