## Why Prompt?

I have a family member who owns his own physical therapy business in Arizona. Through conversations with him, I've heard about the administrative challenges that rehab therapy practices face - the paper-heavy processes, billing complexity, and time spent on documentation instead of patient care. When I saw Prompt's mission to automate and modernize this workflow, it caught my attention as a problem worth solving.

I bring 10+ years of Laravel PHP experience along with the tech stack fundamentals you're looking for (MySQL, REST APIs, modern JavaScript). While I don't have production Vue.js experience, I've worked with it on side projects and understand component-based frameworks well from my React.js work. I'm a quick learner and comfortable picking up new frontend frameworks. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to meaningful healthcare software while continuing to grow my technical skills.
