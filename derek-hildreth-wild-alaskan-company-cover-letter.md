Hiring Team  
Wild Alaskan Company

I came across the Senior Fullstack Software Engineer position while browsing Built In for senior PHP roles that felt like a personal connection, and Wild Alaskan Company immediately stood out. Here's why: There are two food trucks here in Montana that I get genuinely excited about. The first is "On the Hook," which serves the best fish and chips I've ever had - and I'm comparing that to fish and chips in London. The second is "Peeler's Wild Alaskan Seafood." My special needs son and I have a special bond over their salmon. We bring it home and slow cook it on the pellet grill, and it's become one of our things together. 

Living in Montana, I feel like we share a similar spirit with Alaska - the same appreciation for wild spaces, quality food sourced right, and the rugged independence that comes with life in places like these. Every time I visit these food trucks, I think about the supply chain that makes these experiences possible. Getting quality, line-caught fish from Alaska to Montana while maintaining that level of freshness is no small feat. That's the problem Wild Alaskan Company is solving at scale, and building the technology that enables people everywhere to have these same experiences is genuinely exciting to me.

I bring 8+ years of deep Laravel PHP expertise paired with experience in Vue.js, which aligns well with your tech stack. At Technologic Systems, I built and managed a custom e-commerce platform serving 8,000+ customers with $10-15M in annual revenue, integrating with ERP systems for real-time inventory synchronization and dynamic pricing. At General Indemnity Group, I've led the consolidation of backend systems into a unified Laravel stack while establishing TDD practices and CI/CD pipelines. While my deepest expertise is on the backend with Laravel, I've worked with Vue.js in personal projects and am excited to grow my frontend skills with your team.

I understand the complexity of building systems that bridge physical operations with digital experiences. I'm comfortable writing PHPUnit tests, conducting thorough code reviews, and collaborating with product managers to translate business needs into technical solutions. I've been working remotely from Montana for years and thrive in distributed teams.

I notice Montana isn't currently in your list of approved remote states. I'm hoping you might consider making an exception given the strong cultural and geographic connection between Montana and Alaska, and my genuine enthusiasm for your mission. I'm happy to discuss any concerns about remote work from Montana.

I'd love to learn more about your technical roadmap and the challenges you're most focused on solving as you scale.

Thank you for considering my application.
