To Hiring Managers and Engineering Leaders,

I don't just write code—I build systems that people rely on every day.

With 10+ years in software engineering, I've architected systems processing millions in transactions, built platforms serving thousands of daily users, and created mobile apps that help people stay connected to what they love. What drives me is the belief that great software is fundamentally an act of service.

**Why I Build What I Build**

Every technical decision starts with a simple question: does this genuinely help someone? Whether consolidating three backend systems into a unified Laravel stack at General Indemnity Group or building LookOver (my powersports maintenance app from concept to market), I'm motivated by integrity, meaningful work, and the excitement of solving real problems with precision and care.

I've spent years working in complex systems. At Pathlabs, I architected data pipelines that normalized $200M+ in annual ad spend across platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. At General Indemnity, I've led the technical transformation of a surety bond marketplace, introducing TDD practices and CI/CD pipelines that reduced our release cycle from days to hours. But the technical achievements matter less than the human impact: helping agencies manage their campaigns more effectively, enabling agents to serve their clients better, helping riders keep their machines running so they can focus on the trail ahead.

**What I Bring to Your Team**

My technical foundation is solid: deep expertise in PHP (Laravel), strong production experience with TypeScript and Node.js, hands-on experience with AWS, PostgreSQL, and modern CI/CD practices. I've integrated AI capabilities including OpenAI APIs for intelligent recommendations, and I'm excited about AI's potential to make our systems more capable while maintaining the engineering discipline and quality standards users depend on.

But what sets me apart is how I approach the work. I believe in building connection with teammates, fostering collaboration through code reviews and mentorship, and maintaining the integrity that makes complex projects succeed over the long haul. At Pathlabs, I mentored a 4-person engineering team while architecting AWS infrastructure. At General Indemnity, I transformed team workflows from Excel spreadsheets to structured Jira and Confluence processes, establishing documentation that improved coordination and new hire productivity.

I get excited about new ideas, technology that genuinely serves people, and the challenge of doing hard things well. Whether introducing TDD practices, architecting offline-first mobile experiences, or leading zero-downtime database migrations, I bring the same energy and attention to detail I apply when skiing black diamonds or navigating remote ridgelines on my dirt bike.

**Let's Build Something That Matters**

If you're working on technology that makes a real difference—whether in healthcare, fintech, SaaS, or emerging applications—I'd love to help shape what you're building. I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful work, continue growing as an engineer, and collaborate with teams who share a commitment to excellence and genuine impact.

Currently building LookOver from the ground up, I understand both the entrepreneurial mindset and the technical discipline required to ship software that people actually want to use. The best software happens when technical skill meets human purpose, and I'd be excited to bring both to your next challenge.

Best regards,

Derek Hildreth
