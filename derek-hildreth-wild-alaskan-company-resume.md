## Why Wild Alaskan Company

There are two food trucks here in Montana that I get genuinely excited about. The first is "On the Hook," which serves what I'm convinced is the best fish and chips in the state (and I'm comparing that to fish and chips I had in London). The second is "Peeler's Wild Alaskan Seafood" - my special needs son and I have a special bond over their salmon, which we bring home and slow cook on the pellet grill. Living in Montana, I feel like we share a similar spirit with Alaska - the same appreciation for wild spaces, quality food sourced right, and the rugged independence that comes with life in places like these. Every time I visit these food trucks, I think about the supply chain that makes these experiences possible - getting quality, line-caught fish from Alaska to Montana while maintaining that level of freshness. That's the kind of problem Wild Alaskan Company is solving at scale, and building technology that enables people everywhere to access that same quality seafood experience is genuinely exciting. My experience building e-commerce platforms and managing complex supply chain integrations aligns directly with what you're building as you scale your vertically integrated platform.
