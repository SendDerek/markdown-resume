Hiring Team  
Calendly

I saw the Full Stack Engineer positions at Calendly and had to reach out. Throughout my recent job search, I've been on the receiving end of countless Calendly links, and every single time I've been impressed by how effortless the experience is. The UX is exceptional - clean, intuitive, and it just gets out of the way so you can focus on what matters: getting the meeting scheduled. That kind of thoughtful simplicity is what draws me to your product and makes me want to be part of building it.

Great software shouldn't make you think about it, and Calendly nails that. Whether I'm scheduling interviews or coordinating with hiring teams, the experience is consistently smooth. That polish and reliability at scale is hard to achieve, and it's exactly the kind of product work that excites me as an engineer.

I bring 10+ years of full stack experience with strong alignment to your tech stack. At General Indemnity Group, I've been leading end-to-end feature delivery on a marketplace platform (connecting users with service providers, similar to your commerce flows). My deepest expertise is in backend systems - Node.js, PHP/Laravel, PostgreSQL, GraphQL APIs - with solid production experience building React frontends and working with TypeScript in mixed stack environments. I'm adaptable and pick up new technologies quickly; I'm excited to deepen my TypeScript expertise working in a TypeScript-first environment. I've taken ownership of features from technical discovery through release and ongoing maintenance, always with a bias toward small, incremental, high-quality releases.

Your requirement for a pragmatic, entrepreneurial approach resonates with me. I'm building LookOver, a React Native mobile app for the powersports community, so I deeply understand the scrappy MVP mindset. You make trade-offs, ship experiments fast, and validate value quickly. That's how you learn what users actually need versus what you think they need.

What excites me most about these roles is the combination of hands-on technical work with the opportunity to influence architecture and mentor other engineers. At Pathlabs, I mentored a 4-person team while architecting AWS infrastructure and building GraphQL APIs for an advertising platform managing substantial ad spend. I love that balance of building and teaching.

I'm also proficient with AI tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude - I use them daily to scaffold code, generate tests, and accelerate experiments. I know when to use them and when not to, based on risk and correctness considerations.

I'd love to hear more about your technical roadmap and the challenges you're most excited to tackle as you scale. How do you balance the speed needed to capitalize on Calendly's growth momentum with the reliability that millions of users depend on?

Thanks for considering my application.
