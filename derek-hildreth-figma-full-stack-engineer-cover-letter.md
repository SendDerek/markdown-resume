Hiring Team  
Figma

I'm reaching out about the Full Stack Engineer position at Figma. As both a user and admirer of your platform, I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity.

I first encountered Figma at Pathlabs, where UI designers would hand off designs to me as a developer. I was impressed by how easy it made creating amazing UIs and how seamlessly it facilitated that designer-developer handoff. Since then, I've become a regular user myself, using Figma for my LookOver app design and marketing materials. The ease of use and the fact that it works both online and on desktop makes it feel effortless compared to the Adobe tools I've used for years.

As someone with a creative background (I've worked extensively with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and open-source alternatives like Gimp and Inkscape), I appreciate what Figma has done to make design more accessible. Building the engineering systems that power these creative experiences feels like the perfect intersection of my technical and creative interests.

I bring 10+ years shipping full-stack applications in production. At General Indemnity Group, I've led end-to-end delivery of marketplace platforms serving thousands of users, working closely with stakeholders to translate complex requirements into scalable technical solutions. My experience spans the full stack including PHP/Laravel and Node.js backends, React and TypeScript frontends, PostgreSQL databases, and AWS infrastructure.

I'm a polyglot engineer comfortable across many languages and frameworks. Your stack mentions React/TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, C++, and PostgreSQL. I have production experience with TypeScript, Python, C++, and PostgreSQL, and I'm confident picking up Ruby and Go quickly. Early in my career at Oracle, I worked across 7 different programming languages in a single year to support diverse technical requirements, which taught me how to adapt to new technologies rapidly. I'm comfortable working across the entire application, from polished user experiences to scalable backend services.

Your emphasis on cross-functional collaboration aligns perfectly with how I work best. At Pathlabs, I partnered closely with Product Managers to define clear scopes and ship advertising platform features managing substantial ad spend. I've mentored engineering teams through code reviews and architectural discussions, and I genuinely enjoy the balance of hands-on building with technical leadership and knowledge sharing.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to work on products that millions of people use daily. I'm also building my own mobile app (LookOver, for the powersports community), so I understand the founder mindset and what it takes to ship products that solve real problems. This experience gives me perspective on both the technical and product sides of building something people care about.

I'm drawn to Figma's value of "Grow as you go." I'm constantly learning and evolving as an engineer. I've been exploring AI-enhanced development workflows, integrating OpenAI APIs into my own projects, and staying current with modern development practices. The chance to push the boundaries of what's possible with real-time collaborative systems while working alongside talented engineers and designers is exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for.

I'd love to learn more about the technical challenges your team is tackling and how this role would contribute to Figma's growth. How do you balance moving fast with the reliability that millions of users depend on for their daily workflows?

Thank you for considering my application.
