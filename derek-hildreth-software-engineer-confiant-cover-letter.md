Hiring Team  
Confiant

I came across the Software Engineer position at Confiant while browsing Built In for remote PHP roles at the Senior level and up. After reading about your mission and what you're building, I knew I had to apply.

What really drew me in was your focus on protecting businesses and people from malicious advertising. This feels personal to me. My grandfather was recently taken advantage of by a false, AI-powered ad, and seeing how these scams can affect real people hit home. The work you're doing to rid the digital world of malvertising matters, and I want to be part of that mission.

I bring 10+ years of backend engineering experience with deep expertise in PHP/Laravel, which aligns well with your tech stack. At Pathlabs, I spent two years building advertising platform features managing $200M+ in annual ad spend. I built large-scale ETL pipelines normalizing data from 20+ advertising platforms, processing millions of records daily. I understand the AdTech ecosystem from the inside, which gives me context for the threats you're working to prevent.

Your requirements around high-scale, high-availability systems resonate with my recent work. At General Indemnity Group, I've led the consolidation of backend systems into a unified Laravel stack while establishing TDD practices and CI/CD pipelines. I'm comfortable working across the full stack, debugging production issues rapidly, and collaborating end-to-end from problem research through deployment. The scale you're operating at (tens of millions of transactions daily) is exactly the kind of challenge I thrive on.

I'm also well-positioned for your remote-first culture. I'm in Montana (Mountain Time, well within 5 hours of EST) and have years of experience with asynchronous communication across distributed teams. I understand the discipline remote work requires and the importance of clear communication when collaborating across time zones.

I'd love to learn more about the technical challenges you're tackling as you scale and the problems you're most excited to solve. How do you balance the speed needed to catch new malvertising threats with the reliability that your customers depend on?

Thank you for considering my application.
